description: "Jimmy Page says he had never heard the Spirit song he is accused of copying until he was sued for allegedly plagiarizing it. Speaking in court last week, the Led Zeppelin guitarist stood by his claim that the opening to his classic track \"Stairway to Heaven\" did not copy a signature guitar passage from Spirit's song \"Taurus,\" which appeared on the American group's self-titled 1968 debut album."
