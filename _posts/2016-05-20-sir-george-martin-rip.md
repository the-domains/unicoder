    description: 'The scene backstage last November at the American Music Awards, that annual gathering of pop perennials and idiosyncratic arrivistes, was carnivalesque: Niall and Liam of One Direction toddled about trying to snap a picture with a selfie stick, while Zayn, their bandmate at the time, smoked coolly out of frame; Ne-Yo was there in a leopard-Â­print blazer two sizes too small; Lil Wayne was wandering around, alone, wearing absurd shoes.'

description: "The greatest argument for George Martin's musical genius may be this: He had an open mind and was willing to take what he later called \"a calculated risk\" in auditioning and signing The Beatles. Think about that. Martin didn't like their \"old stuff,\" a bunch of cover tunes, or their \"mediocre\" originals."
